### Steps to Launch the Project After Cloning

**Clone the repository and install dependencies:**

Ensure your colleague clones the project and installs all dependencies:
```bash
git clone <your-repository-URL>
cd <project-folder-name>
npm install
```

**Set up the iOS project (if using iOS):**

To work with iOS, your colleague must install dependencies via CocoaPods:
```bash
cd ios
pod install
cd ..
```

**Launch the project:**

Your colleague can launch the project on Android or iOS by executing the corresponding commands:

**For Android:**
```bash
npx react-native run-android
```

**For iOS:**
```bash
npx react-native run-ios
```

### Firebase Access

If your project uses Firebase features (e.g., authentication or Firestore), your colleague must have access to the Firebase Console to manage the project and verify settings.

**Add your colleague to Firebase Console:**

Log in to the Firebase Console.
